# Migration to v0.5.3

`Only for local mode version under v0.5.2`

## Notice

1. If you are using old version earlier than `v0.5.2` please upgrade to `v0.5.2` first.
2. If you are running in `cluster mode` and keep useing `etcd` that you don't need to migrate, because everything still in etcd & s3.

Version 0.5.3 is a broken version for local mode, it brings `Sqlite`, `PostgreSQL` and `DynamoDB` support. and dropped `sled db` support. So you need migrate `file list index` and `metadata` into new storage.

## Download v0.5.3

Download `v0.5.3` replace your old version binary or docker image and then run it. there is nothing in your new version now.

## Migration

### Binary version

If you are running binary version, just run the follow commands:

```
./openobserve migrate-meta
./openobserve migrate-file-list
```

If there is no error, congratulations, migration is done. you can login your system now.

### Docker version

You should use `debug` version image that can let you login into the pod.

```

```

After change to the debug pod, you can login into the pod, and run:
